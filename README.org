#+Title: My Dotfiles
#+Author: VirginFuhrer
* Introduction
 Here is my dotfiles , all configuration files that I use . Consider that
 dotfiles works for me and are not meant to work for everybody . In order them
 to work you must install all dependecies and put them where you need.
* What I use && How to install 
This is probably the worst dotfiles you have ever seen.
+ =Awesome-git=, =Openbox=, =Bspwm= - window managers I use 
+ =sxhkd= - my hotkey daemon , now I don't use it just for bspwm but also for
  openbox and other wm because I can port my keybindings over other wm without
  pain. Also it easier to write configurations . 
+ =rofi= - program launcher 
+ =polybar= , =tint2= , =lemonbar= - bars I use 
+ =neovim= - my editor ( even though I hope to emacs some times, config sits in
  another repository)
+ =thunar= - the GUI file manager I use
+ =urxvt= - the terminal I use 
+ =zsh= , aka the zoomer shell , is the shell I use  
Besides installing these application , you also should make sure that you load
Xresources everytime because are used by my =lemonbar= , and =awesomewm= setup .
